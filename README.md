# accounts

Richard's quirky money management system.

## What is it?

A web app that ingests bank and credit card transactions, allows you to
categorize them, and produces some arguably useful summaries of your spending.

This is absolutely a case of me trying to figure out what questions to ask
about my spending patterns, and building a system that can answer those
questions. It's very specific to those questions. You probably have a different
set of questions you'd like answers to. It's certainly doesn't help you budget,
or save for particular goals, or any of the things that most money management
software is trying to do.

It's also absolutely specific to the format of the CSV files generated by the
financial institutions I do business with, although it's probably not hard to
extend this.

## Building and running

`make docker` will build a container. I use a docker-compose fragment something
like this to run it:

```
  accounts:
    image: rcbilson/accounts:latest
    pull_policy: never
    ports:
      - 80:9090
    volumes:
      - ./accounts/data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## What's under the hood

The frontend is Vite + JavaScript + React + Material UI. The backend is
Go + Sqlite.

## Known issues

I shoulda used TypeScript.

The JS bundle that the client needs to download is way too big. I have spent
literally no time optimizing this.
